## Description

This utility can read backup file of Donner B1 synthesizer (TB-303 clone) and convert to Roland T-8 Bass patterns.
Also it can pretty print Donner B1 patterns.

Note: this is not an official utility and has been created by reverse engineering file formats of both Donner B1 and Roland T-8.
